# node-modules

A template for building a Node.js library with **no `dependencies`** based on esbuild.

The Principle is no `dependencies` in `package.json`, every dependencie has built-in the library `dist`.

## Quick Start

Install dependencies

```bash
$ yarn
```

Build

```bash
$ yarn build
```

Test

```bash
$ yarn test
```

Publish, same as [npm-publish](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-publish).

```bash
$ npm publish
```
